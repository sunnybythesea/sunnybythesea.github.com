<a href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a> is a beautiful framework. 

I want to talk about the philosophy of why Processing matters 
and eventually it's spin-off (Processing.js).

Back in the 80's when BASIC was all the rage. 

It was easy for kids and adults alike to start playing and experimenting...

Books are great, but prototypes are better

Here is an example of processing.js in action.

<script src="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/processing-js/processing-js/processing-1.4.1.js" 
type="text/javascript"></script>
<canvas data-processing-sources="/downloads/code/clock.pde" width="200" height="200">
</canvas></p>
<div style="height:0px;width:0px;overflow:hidden;"></div>

{% include_code clock.pde lang:java%}
