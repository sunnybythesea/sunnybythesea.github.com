    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Writing is a very primal instinct, like drawing or singing. We humans are social creatures who seek to explore new ideas and communicate our own. Writing provides with a way to do so in a way that <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/145140-a-book-is-made-from-a-tree-it-is-an">transcends time and space</a>.</p>

<p>Writing also opens an avenue for self-discovery. Most great thinkers and inventors were also writers who kept diaries all their lives. Leonardo Da Vinci is perhaps most well-known for his journals. Today, thanks to technology, our thoughts can be instantly shared easily with the world, and in a way that even transcends the medium. These words can theoretically live until the end of time since they are no longer tied to the medium itself.</p>

<p>This humble blog is my attempt at making sense of my world. Thanks for dropping by.</p>
